You will need to know how to compile a program. The dependencies are SDL, QuesoGLC and OpenGL.</p>

<h2>How to play?</h2>
<p><strong style="color: grey">Mice </strong> will appear continuously. Your goal
is to bring more mice to your house than other players before the time is over.</p>
<p><strong style="color: lightblue">Arrows:</strong> If you play using your mouse, you have 2 ways
to place arrows, either use left-click/right-click/wheel-up/wheel-down, or click
and maintain pressed then go to one direction and release.
If you play using the keyboard, use the arrows to move the cursor and I,J,K,L to place arrows.
In any case, you cannot place more than 3 arrows.</p>
<p><strong style="color: red">Snakes</strong> will eat mice they meet until they get sick of eating too much and die.
If a snake reaches your house, you loose 10 points.</p>
<p>The <strong style="color: rgb(100%, 70%, 0%);">golden mouse</strong> will trigger a
special event for 10 seconds. These are: mouse mania (much more mice appear),
snake attack (many snakes appear), color madness (new mice are randomly colored),
eagle (you get the eagle which prevents snakes from attacking you).



<h2>Want to make your own maze?</h2>
<p>You have a good idea to make a maze?
It is very simple to make one, simply go in the mazes directory and
create a text file with a similar syntax as the others
(the maze format is kind of an ASCII art representation of the maze, <a href="maze1.txt">click here to see an example</a>).
You can send me (almacha <abbr lang="en" title="replace with an @">AT</abbr> almacha.org) your maze
and I will include it in the next release, with its title and your name shown under it
(by sending it, you allow unlimited redistribution and modification).</p>
